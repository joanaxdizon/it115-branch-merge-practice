This is a study-in-contrasts piece with an undercurrent about the need of intimacy versus the need for independence. The story is about a barber whose mind was controlled by a parasite. It takes place in a xenophobic police state. The story ends with a prayer. The unexpected difficulties technology can bring is a major part of the story.

Be sure to add coll character names, etc. Oh, an chapter 2!
